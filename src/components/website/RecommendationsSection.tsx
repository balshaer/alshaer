          I am pleased to recommend Baraa, who worked as a Front-End Developer at PTIT company. During his time with us, Baraa consistently demonstrated exceptional technical skills in front-end development, with a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of modern web technologies. Baraa was highly dedicated, always eager to learn, and contributed significantly to the success of our projects. His ability to collaborate effectively with both the development team and other departments made him a valuable asset to our company. He consistently met deadlines and produced high-quality work that exceeded our expectations. I am confident that Baraa will bring the same level of professionalism, commitment, and expertise to any team he joins. I highly recommend him for any front-end development role.`,
